  Our project is a version of the popular board game, Settlers of Catan, and is
  based on the online game, Colonist. Players are able to perform similar 
  actions to Catan, such as build roads and settlements; buy and play development cards;
  and ultimately acquire victory points. The interface is supported by the 
  terminal, in which players can type commands to play the game and see their 
  progress displayed on the hexagonal board.
